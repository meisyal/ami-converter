**ami-converter** is a desktop-based multimedia converter. Multimedia itself
contains data or information such as text, image, audio, and video. This

* Video: Avi (AVI), MPEG-1, MPEG-2, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, FLV, and WMV video files

If you choose the audio file, you can choose the bitrate. Bitrate is from 16 to
320 kbps. Then, if you choose the video file, you can set not only bitrate but
also frame-rate. Frame-rate is from 15 to 60 fps. 

Beside that, this application gives you the information about multimedia file.
